## Facial-Expression-Recognition
In this project, I have done the following tasks:

    Developed a facial expression recognition model in Keras
    Builded and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN)
    Deployed the trained model to a web interface with Flask
    Applied the model to predict the facial expressions on real-time video streams and image data.
